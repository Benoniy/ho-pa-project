# Team Project
## What is the Project?
### Project Brief
Requirement 1 - Terraform: Take our IT Job watch application and deploy using Terraform to orchestrate the infrastructure on AWS and get the application running correctly. This will need to include some sort of vulnerability scanning. Terrascan could be used but I would like you to research the best tool for the job and report back which one you are going to use. This included in a CICD pipeline would be a bonus. 

Requirement 2 â€“ K8S: Deploy the IT Job Watch application using Containers and K8S instead of traditional route above. We would like 3 pods for our app to run on.

### Tools
- AWS
- Terraform
- Kubernetes
- Jenkins
- Terrascan
- Checkov

### Steps to Implement
- Use Terraform to create dependencies and start EC2 instances
- Use Kubernetes to create containers within EC2 instances
- Setup CICD pipeline with Jenkins
- Setup vulnerability scanning (Terrascan or Checkov)
